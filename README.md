Project for my dissertation - "Real-Time Ray-Traced Global Illumination of Procedural Surfaces"

Features - (Implemented in DX12 using DXR)
- Real-Time Bi-Directional Path-Tracing
- Image Space Photon-Mapping (*extended to support procedural geometry)
- Intersection Shader implementation of implicit, and analytic surfaces
- Constructive Solid Geometry implementation allows to subtract, add, and take the intersection of these surfaces
